Microservices Trend
-------------------

- Emerged in the last few years
- Partially based on companies' willingness to speed up their release
  cycles.
- They want to be agile by iterating often

*"Write a paper promising salvation, make it a structured something or
a virtual something, or abstract, distributed or higher-order or
applicative, and you can almost be certain of having started a new
cult."*

Origins of Service-Oriented Architecture
----------------------------------------

*"SOA predates microservices, and its core principle is the idea that
you organize applications into a discrete unit of functionality that can
be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently."*

Wikipedia

### SOA Unit

- Each unit in this preceding definition is:
    - a self-contained service
    - which implements one facet of a business, and
    - provides its feature through some interface.

SOA Manifesto (<http://www.soa-manifesto.org>)
----------------------------------------------

- Service orientation is a paradigm that frames what you do.
- Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a type of architecture that
  results from applying service orientation.
- **Goal**: help organizations consistently deliver sustainable
  business value, with increased agility and cost-effectiveness, in
  line with changing business needs.

### SOA Manifesto Priorities

- **Business value** over technical strategy
- **Strategic goals** over project-specific benefits
- **Intrinsic interoperability** over custom integration
- **Shared services** over specific-purpose implementations
- **Flexibility** over optimization
- **Evolutionary refinement** over pursuit of initial perfection

### SOA Manifesto Guiding Principles (1)

- Respect the social and power structure of the organization.
- Recognize that SOA ultimately demands change on many levels.
- The scope of SOA adoption can vary. Keep efforts manageable and
  within meaningful boundaries.
- Products and standards alone will neither give you SOA nor apply the
  service orientation paradigm for you.

### SOA Manifesto Guiding Principles (2)

- SOA can be realized through a variety of technologies and standards.
- Establish a uniform set of enterprise standards and policies based
  on industry, de facto, and community standards.
- Pursue uniformity on the outside while allowing diversity on the
  inside.

### SOA Manifesto Guiding Principles (3)

- Identify services through collaboration with business and technology
  stakeholders.
- Maximize service usage by considering the current and future scope
  of utilization.
- Verify that services satisfy business requirements and goals.
- Evolve services and their organization in response to real use.

### SOA Manifesto Guiding Principles (4)

- Separate the different aspects of a system that change at different
  rates.
- Reduce implicit dependencies and publish all external dependencies
  to increase robustness and reduce the impact of change.
- At every level of abstraction, organize each service around a
  cohesive and manageable unit of functionality

### SOA and microservices

- At the end of the day, SOA can be everything and anything as long as
  you are not running all your application code into a single process.
- microservices are one specialization of SOA
    - because they fulfill some of the SOA goals which are to build
      apps with standalone components that interact with each other.

The monolithic approach
-----------------------

- Example: hotel booking site
- Search on the hotel website:
    1. It runs a couple of SQL queries against its hotels' database.
    2. An HTTP request to a partner's service is made to add more
       hotels to the list.
    3. An HTML results page is generated using an HTML template engine.

### Booking a room

1. The customer gets created in the database if needed, and has to
   authenticate.
2. Payment is carried out by interacting with the bank web service.
3. The app saves the payment details in the database for legal reasons.
4. A receipt is generated using a PDF generator.
5. A recap email is sent to the user using the email service.
6. A reservation email is forwarded to the third-party hotel using the
   email service.
7. A database entry is added to keep track of the reservation.

Monolithic Architecture")

### Benefits

- Single code base
- Deployment is a no-brainer
- If your application stays small, this model works well and is easy
  to maintain for a single team.

### Issues (1)

- If you need to make a sweeping change that is large in scope such as
  changing your banking service or your database layer, the whole
  application gets into a very unstable state.
- Small changes can also generate collateral damage because different
  parts of the system have different uptime and stability
  requirements.

### Issues (2)

- Uncontrolled growth
- Big software projects usually take a couple of years to mature, and
  then they slowly start to turn into an incomprehensible mess that's
  hard to maintain
- As the complexity grows, fewer people fully understand the
  implications of every small change they make

Summary of the Pros and Cons of the Monolithic Approach
-------------------------------------------------------

- Starting a project as a monolith is easy, and probably the best
  approach.
- A centralized database simplifies the design and organization of the
  data.
- Deploying one application is simple.
- Any change in the code can impact unrelated features. When something
  breaks, the whole application may break.
- Solutions to scale your application are limited: you can deploy
  several instances, but if one particular feature inside the app
  takes all the resources, it impacts everything.
- As the code base grows, it's hard to keep it clean and under
  control.

Flask Web App
-------------

- Helps you
    - focus on the business logic
    - split your code into small packages
    - externalize some of your code into Flask extensions and small
      Python packages
- The UNIX Philosophy: "Small is beautiful."
- But be careful of **dependency hell**.

The microservice approach
-------------------------

![Booking App Microservice
Architecture](images/booking_app2.jpeg "Booking App Microservice Architecture")

### Components (1)

1. **Booking UI**: A frontend service, which generates the web user
   interface, and interacts with all the other microservices.
2. **PDF reporting service**: A very simple service that would create
   PDFs for the receipts or any other document given a template and
   some data.
3. **Search**: A service that can be queried to get a list of hotels
   given a city name. This service has its own database.

### Components (2)

1. **Payments**: A service that interacts with the third-party bank
   service, and manages a billing database. It also sends e-mails on
   successful payments.
2. **Reservations**: Stores reservations, and generates PDFs.
3. **Users**: Stores the user information, and interacts with users via
   emails.
4. **Authentication**: An OAuth 2-based service that returns
   authentication tokens, which each microservice can use to
   authenticate when calling others.


- In this design, each component communicates using the HTTP protocol,
  and features are made available through RESTful web services.
- There's no centralized database
- Each microservice deals internally with its own data structures
- The data that gets in and out uses a language-agnostic format like
  JSON (or XML or YAML)

### Microservices (1)

- A web application designed with microservices is a composition of
  several microservices, which may interact with each other through
  HTTP to provide the whole system.
- A microservice is
    - a lightweight application, which provides a narrowed list of
      features with a well-defined contract.
    - a component with a single responsibility, which can be developed
      and deployed independently.

### Microservices (2)

- In the book (and in this course), all our microservices are just
  simple web applications that
    - use the HTTP protocol, and
    - consume and produce JSON when it's not a UI.

### Microservice Benefits

- Separation of concerns
- Smaller projects to deal with
- More scaling and deployment options

### Separation of concerns

- Each microservice can be developed independently by a separate team
  (or individual).
- Loose coupling:
    - improves the overall project velocity a lot
    - similar to the single responsibility principle.
- The single responsibility principle (Robert Martin):
    - a class should have only one reason to change
    - each class should provide a single, well-defined feature
    - applied to microservices: each microservice should focus on a
      single role.

### Smaller Projects

- Reduce complexity by breaking the project into smaller projects
- Each smaller project:
    - is simpler
    - could be developed on different frameworks
    - but integration of the smaller projects together can also create
      some complexity

### Scaling and deployment

- Having your application split into components makes it easier to
  scale depending on your constraints.
- CPU-consuming microservices can be deployed on machines with good
  CPUs, but with less RAM and disk space
- RAM-consuming microservices can be deployed on machines with lots of
  RAM but with weak CPUs or and less disk space
- Data-consuming microservices can be deployed on specialized data
  processing systems, such as Hadoop or Spark

Summary of Microservices Benefits
---------------------------------

- A team can develop each microservice independently
    - they can use whatever technological stack makes sense
    - they can define a custom release cycle
    - all they need to define is a language-agnostic HTTP API
- Developers break the application complexity into logical components:
  each microservice focuses on doing one thing well.
- Since microservices are standalone applications, there's a finer
  control on deployments, which makes scaling easier.

Microservices pitfalls
----------------------

- Building an application with microservices
    - has a lot of benefits
    - but it's not a silver bullet by all means
- Microservices main problems:
    - Illogical splitting
    - More network interactions
    - Data storing and sharing
    - Compatibility issues
    - Testing

### Illogical splitting

- Premature splitting is the root of all evil.
- If there's any doubt that the split makes sense, keeping the code
  in the same app is the safe bet.
- It's always easier to split apart some of the code into a new
  microservice later than to merge back to two microservices in the
  same code base because the decision turned out to be wrong.

### More network interactions

- What do we do if a microservice is unreachable because of network
  issues?
- Latency and bandwidth issues
- Added costs

### Data storing and sharing

- An effective microservice needs to be independent of other
  microservices
- Ideally, it should not share a database
- Avoiding data duplication as much as possible while keeping
  microservices in isolation is one of the biggest challenges in
  designing microservices-based applications.

### Compatibility issues

- What happens when a feature change impacts several microservices?
    - Will it work with older versions?
    - Do you need to change and deploy several services at once?
    - Does it mean you've just stumbled on some services that should
      probably be merged back together?
- A good versioning and API design hygiene help to mitigate those
  issues

### Testing

- You need to have a robust and agile deployment process to be
  efficient.
- You need to be able to play with your whole application when you
  develop it.
- You can't fully test things out with just one piece of the puzzle.
- Microservices-style architecture boosts deployment tools innovation,
  and deployment tools lower the bar for the approval of
  microservices-style architecture.

Summary of Microservices Pitfalls
---------------------------------

- Premature splitting of an application into microservices can lead to
  architectural problems
- Network interactions between microservices add weaknesses spots and
  additional overhead
- Testing and deploying microservices can be complex
- And the biggest challenge: data sharing between microservices is
  hard
