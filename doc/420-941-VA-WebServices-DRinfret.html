<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>Public RESTful APIs of Web services have become valuable assets in the development of Web-connected applications. The availability of Web service APIs on the Internet allows developers to build a variety of applications that leverage these services into ever-evolving software integrations.</p>
<p>This course completes student training in the Web programming competencies by extending the server-side programming skills to include Web services.</p>
<p>Students will be able to design, implement, test, deploy, document, and present their own original RESTful Web service.</p>
<h2 id="courses-role-in-the-program">Course’s role in the program</h2>
<p>This course completes student training in Web programming competencies by extending their server-side programming skills to cover topics related to designing, implementing, and securing Web Services, including process-to-process communications. This course leverages the knowledge and skills acquired in the 420-931-VA: Front-End Web Programming and 420-951-VA: Transactional Web Applications courses.</p>
<p>Many students complete internships in the Web programming field. These three courses prepare them for this experience.</p>

<h3 id="late-work">Late work</h3>
<p>A 10% penalty for each late day will be applied on assignments submitted after the deadline. The project (LIA) and the exam cannot be submitted late. Exceptions can only be granted only according to the College policies and procedures.</p>
<h2 id="project-learning-integration-assessment">Project (Learning Integration Assessment)</h2>
<p>In a team setting, students design, implement, and test a Web service of their own thinking and design. These Web services are deployed on free cloud service accounts or a local server providing similar testing capabilities. The services are tested using a continuous integration (CI) service. Students document their Web service API in a final report and present their final implementation to all students in the class.</p>
<h3 id="evaluation-criteria-for-the-learning-integration-assessment">Evaluation criteria for the learning integration assessment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Compliance with the requirements</li>
<li>Correctness of the solution with respect to the problem statement</li>
<li>Usability of the service</li>
<li>Reactiveness of the process-to-process interaction</li>
<li>Design of the software architecture</li>
<li>Quality of the implementation</li>
<li>Quality of testing and absence of software bugs</li>
<li>Security of the service</li>
<li>Quality of the written user guide and technical documentation</li>
