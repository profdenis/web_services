## Course Description

Public RESTful APIs of Web services have become valuable assets in the
development of Web-connected applications. The availability of Web service
APIs on the Internet allows developers to build a variety of applications
that leverage these services into ever-evolving software integrations.

This course completes student training in the Web programming competencies by
extending the server-side programming skills to include Web services.

Students will be able to design, implement, test, deploy, document, and present
their own original RESTful Web service.

## Course's role in the program

This course completes student training in Web programming competencies by
extending their server-side programming skills to cover topics related to
designing, implementing, and securing Web Services, including process-to-process
communications. This course leverages the knowledge and skills acquired
in the 420-931-VA: Front-End Web Programming and 420-951-VA: Transactional Web
Applications courses.

Many students complete internships in the Web programming field. These three
courses prepare them for this experience.

## Statement of course competencies

The competency **00SV Develop data exchange services** will be covered
completely in this course.

## Course-level Learning Outcome

Students will be able to design, implement, test, deploy, and document secure
RESTful Web Services. They will also be able to build applications that consume
these services.

## Key Learning Outcomes

In the development, testing, and deployment of secure RESTful Web Services,
students will

1. Analyze the requirements to be satisfied.
2. Prepare the appropriate development environment.
3. Design and implement a database matching the system requirements.
4. Design, implement, and test the application logic for the service.
5. Design and implement a sample application which consumes the service.
6. Integrate automated behavioural testing to control the quality of the
   service.
7. Deploy the service on an available server.
8. Produce the documentation for the service.

## Required reading material (Textbook)

There is no required textbook for this course. Lecture notes will be
provided through Omnivox, along with a list of recommended readings and
tutorials. The list will be updated throughout the course as needed.

## Grading Scheme

| Component     | Grade | Approx. due date |
|---------------|-------|------------------|
| Assignment 1  | 20%   | February 24      |
| Assignment 2  | 20%   | March 24         |
| Exam          | 30%   | March 31         |
| Project (LIA) | 30%   | April 5          |

### Late work

A 10% penalty for each late day will be applied on assignments submitted
after the deadline. The project (LIA) and the exam cannot be submitted late.
Exceptions can only be granted only according to the College policies and
procedures.

## Project (Learning Integration Assessment)

In a team setting, students design, implement, and test a Web service of their
own thinking and design. These Web services are deployed on free cloud service
accounts or a local server providing similar testing capabilities. The services
are tested using a continuous integration (CI) service. Students document their
Web service API in a final report and present their final implementation to all
students in the class.

### Evaluation criteria for the learning integration assessment

- Compliance with the requirements
- Correctness of the solution with respect to the problem statement
- Usability of the service
- Reactiveness of the process-to-process interaction
- Design of the software architecture
- Quality of the implementation
- Quality of testing and absence of software bugs
- Security of the service
- Quality of the written user guide and technical documentation

### Deliverables

- Deliverable 1: Project proposal
- Deliverable 2: Project implementation
- Deliverable 3: Project report and presentation

### SPLI

The quality of English expression will be evaluated and be worth 10% of
the total as part of grading the LIA written reports and in-class
presentations.

## Teaching Methodology

Programming exercises and discussion on sample programs can take place
either during the lecture time or lab period. All meetings will be held
**online** at the time of the scheduled classes using Zoom, through the link
provided on Omnivox.

## College policies & Procedures

There is a set of College policies and procedures covering the rights and
